Sigh...
I'm tired of catching PEOPLE. It seemed so glamorous at first, but it's actually really tedious.
I want to quit, but, well, I already bought a zillion pPHONEs. What would my wife say if I just threw away our nest egg?
...
Say, would you want them? The pPHONEs I mean! You look like a much better PEOPLE catcher than me.
Yes, that's it! I'll give you pPHONEs in exchange for PEOPLE! I'll outsource my PEOPLE catching to you!
I'll give you a good deal. I think 5 pPHONEs per PERSON would be fair. And here, I'll give you your first 5 for free!
