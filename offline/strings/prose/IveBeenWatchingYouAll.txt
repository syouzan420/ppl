I've been        watching you all along, through   your pPHONEs.
I'm astounded.   How quickly you  have grown as a  PERSON! You are  already one of my best PEOPLE.
And you even     bested the DONALD and most of his PEOPLE! Good job!
I did not        anticipate that  he would catch   one of you before I did. That is  to his credit.
And I bet whoever caught HIM is   just thrilled!   Maybe I'll go and catch a DONALD of my own...
...
I can tell you're not happy about this. Honestly,  that's a little  surprising.
What most PEOPLE want in life is  to realize their potential. They want support and  validation for  their efforts.
And that's just  what I've freely given to you!
All I have asked in return is that you incite to   violence amongst themselves all   your eager and  willing brethren.
And I guess,     implicitly, I ask that you ignore my comprehensive surveillance. You didn't even know about it anyway.
But please don't be a stick in the mud. This is the way this world  works. Don't     denigrate it...
...when you can innovate it!
Come back to the lab, and we'll   work together    making everything better for all  PEOPLE!
We'll make PEOPLE build community. We'll make PEOPLE accessible and more useful. We'll make PEOPLE fight for what's really important to them!
Believe me...
It will be a dream come true.
